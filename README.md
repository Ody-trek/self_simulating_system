A simple self-simulation system

To implement a simple self-simulation system based on the concept of "self-simulating machines," although fully simulating self-consciousness remains an unresolved scientific issue, we can start from basic self-reflection and feedback mechanisms to construct a prototype of a "self-simulation system." This system can include a "perception-reaction-feedback" loop, mimicking the system's observation and adjustment of its own state.
